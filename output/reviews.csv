The kitchen was well equipped with all things required to cook and clean. Host was kind enough to leave some goodies like Maggie, bread,etc for us.
The only issue is due to remote location there are not many food options. The nearby hotels easily get overwhelmed in case of more occupancy and refuse to serve outsiders at the last minute.",7 months on Airbnb

For us, this was a five star stay.
Be warned thoug, this might not be the stay for you. If you are from a western country, and want western comfort. Go elsewhere.
But if you want an adventure, go for it.
We were traveling with four children, aged 5, 7, 9 and 10. They loved the stay on the boat. We had a three night stay.
When we had our stay, there was a lot of water, just after the rainy season. And at least during this time, the place was amazing.
The host let us change the schedule when we wanted to, there was no hassle. And there was places to see when we had no plans.
We ate the food, we swam in the water, and we did not get sick. :-)
At night, any light did attract 10000 bugs, so we practised strict light-dissipline after dark. This gave us wonderfull moments of lying on our backs, on top of the boat, in the dark, watching the stars and telling stories.
Again, might not be for you. Most of my friends could not have stayed here. But if you are up for an adventure, and if you are looking at airbnb's in Bangladesh, odds are high you are at least a bit of an adventurer, go for it.",10 years on Airbnb

This villa has met our expectations in every way. Parking was available in front of the villa. The vast front lawn had beautiful greenery including spice trees such as bay leaves and cinnamon trees. The housekeeper is available 24/7 and helped us check in and out easily. His service was exceptional, we were even able to order breakfast and tea through him! I highly recommend this home away from home.","Calgary, Canada"

They are all very welcoming, friendly and kind - I felt comfortable, safe and at home from the moment I arrived. The house is surrounded by greenery with a beautiful pond out the back. The room is clean, comfortable and quiet. Sawon is responsive to messages and has great local tips - he's also a lot of fun to explore the beautiful surrounds with. I'd highly recommend staying with Sawon and his family.",10 years on Airbnb
